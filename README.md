## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the classic board game Monopoly. The game will be implemented in Java and played through
a graphical user interface (GUI) and will have all the features of the original game, including a game board, dice,
properties, cards, and a bank. The game will be played by 2-4 players, who will take turns rolling the dice and moving around
the board. The game will have a win condition, which will be the last player standing after all other players have gone bankrupt.
